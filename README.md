# Deep Learning

This repository contains a collection of tasks related to deep learning. Each task is organized into separate folders for clarity and ease of access.

## Tasks:

### 1. Building a Neural Network from Scratch

In this task, we delve into the fundamentals of deep learning by creating a neural network from scratch. You'll learn the foundational concepts of neural networks, including forward and backward propagation, activation functions, and gradient descent. This is a great starting point for beginners looking to understand the core principles of deep learning.

### 2. Semantic Segmentation and Colorization

The second task focuses on two fascinating computer vision tasks: semantic segmentation and colorization. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding object class, while colorization aims to add vibrant colors to grayscale images. This task will introduce you to popular deep learning techniques for image analysis and manipulation.

### 3. Text Generation

In the third task, we explore the world of natural language processing (NLP) by creating a text generation model. You'll learn how to train a neural network to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. Text generation is widely used in applications like chatbots, content generation, and creative writing.

### 4. SAM (Segment Anything Model) for Tracking

The fourth and final task involves upgrading the "SAM (Segment Anything Model)" to enable it for object tracking. SAM is a powerful model for segmenting objects in images, and enhancing it for tracking can have numerous applications in computer vision and video analysis. This task will challenge you to bridge the gap between static image analysis and dynamic object tracking.
